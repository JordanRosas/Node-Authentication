# Node-Authentication

Boiler plate node express application that demonstrates a very simple authentication system. 

This repo is for those who are new to creating authentication system from scratch and those that want to poke around a simple application I **do not reccomend ripping this repo and using it for you applications main authentication system.** It can serve as a decent roadmap but make your own ;)
